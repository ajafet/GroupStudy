# GroupStudy 

Group Study is a website application that connects college students taking the same classes with the intention to obtain assistance for upcoming exams. The main goal of this application is to help students that can not make it to the Tutoring Lab or meet the professor during Office Hours. Having the ability to meet with classmates at any suitable time can get students the help they need to succeed. Group Study allows students to: 

* Start a study session specifying a time, location and class course 
* View all study sessions and filter through them 
* Join and leave study sessions

### Functionality 
Group Study consists of a login and register page followed by a page with a left dashboard menu. The dashboard menu consists of the options: All Sessions, Joined Sessions, My Sessions, Create Session and Log Out.
